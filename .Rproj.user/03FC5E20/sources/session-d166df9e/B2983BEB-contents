This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(clipr)
```
```{r}
covidence_naming = function(){
        text_list = read_clip()
        # text_list = strsplit(text, "\n")[[1]]
        text_list = text_list[text_list != ""]
        text_list = trimws(text_list)
        temp = strsplit(text_list[1]," â€“ ")[[1]][2]
        temp = strsplit(temp, " ")[[1]]
        author = temp[1]
        year = temp[2]
        
        title = text_list[3]
        temp = paste(author, year, title, sep = "_")
        temp = paste0(temp, ".pdf")
        write_clip(temp)
        return(temp)
}
```

```{r}
covidence_naming()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
